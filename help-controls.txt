Most of the inputs required to navigate are explained and asked for within the menus!
So all you have to do is follow along, however to clear up some
confusion i will add in how to navigate the main menu as it lacks control info!
aswell as the other menus, just incase :D

HOME: 
can be navigated by typing out any of the selectors login|signup|help|exit
they are not case sensitive so feel free to add caps or type them out in lowercase!
just remember to press enter!

MAIN MENU:
is navigated by entering in 1 through to 6 for the option you would like.

ADD TASK MENU:
requires you to write a title, task information, set task importance,
due date if you desire and then if you would like to create another task!

COMPLETE TASK MENU:

here you can view your completed and not completed tasks. If you would like to 
complete a task, enter the number that corrosponds with the 
task you would like to complete! if you would like to reverse the 
completed task to be "not completed" simply type in the same
number you typed in to complete it and press enter!
Alternatively you will also be asked if you owuld instead like to
return to the main menu.

DELETE TASKS:

To delete a task all you have to do is enter the number the 
task is eg. (1. This would be task one) and then press enter, this will delete the task entirely
so be sure you want to delete the task before pressing enter!
alternatively you can get back to main menu through typing in 0 and pressing enter.

LOGGING OUT:

Logging out is as simple as pressing the logout number!
That will return you to the home page where you can once again choose a menu.

Enjoy!
